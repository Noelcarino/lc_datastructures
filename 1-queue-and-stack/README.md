### Queue & Stack 

# Introduction

    - Two different processing orders
        1) First-in-First-out
        2) Last-in-First-out

    - By completing this card, you should be able to understand
        1) Understand the principle of the processing orders of FIFO and LIFO
        2) Implement these two data structures;
        3) Be familiar with the built-in queue and stack structure;
        4) Solve basic queue-related problems, especial BFS;
        5) Solve basic stacked-related problems;
        6) Understand how system stack helps you when you solve problems using DFS and other recursion algorithms
